# Open Data Policy

## Policy Development

<<<<<<< HEAD
To further increase ACT Public Service awareness and application of open data principles, the Government Information Office is developing a [Proactive Information Disclosure (Open Data) policy](http://actgov.github.io/opendatapolicy/),  hosted on GitHub ready for community feedback. Interested parties are welcome to fork the draft policy. If you do not have a GitHub account, you can also simply [email your feedback to the GIO](mailto:gio@act.gov.au).

The intended audience of this policy is all ACT Government public servants. Technical information - or the 'how' - is kept to an intentional minimum so as to enable staff to comprehend principles of open data, rather than how to implement the policy. Further documentation currently being prepared explores the technical aspects of open data.

## dataACT

[dataACT](http://www.data.act.gov.au/), the ACT Government's open data portal, launched on 30th August 2012 with around 45 datasets, growing to 82 by the end of June 2013. dataACT is led and supported by the ACT GIO in collaboration with Shared Services ICT.

Approaching our second year, there is a renewed focus to release high-value datasets. We have also launched a [consultation](http://gio.act.gov.au/dataset-consultation/) to gather community requests for dataset releases. The suggestions will be used to help inform Directorates of the need for more open data releases.

## Editing the document

The policy document is currently drafted in 'Markdown', a plain-text, easy to read and easy to write format (just like this readme file). For a primer on Markdown check out [John Gruber's original documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

The policy document is `index.md`.
