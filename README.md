# Open Data Policy

## Policy Development

To further increase ACT Public Service awareness and application of open data principles, the Government Information Office is developing a [Proactive Information Disclosure (Open Data) policy](http://actgov.github.io/opendatapolicy/),  hosted on GitHub ready for community feedback. Interested parties are welcome to fork the draft policy and commit changes. If you do not have a GitHub account, you can also simply [email your feedback to the GIO](mailto:gio@act.gov.au).

## dataACT

[dataACT](http://www.data.act.gov.au/), the ACT Government's open data portal, launched on 30th August 2012 with around 45 datasets, growing to 82 by the end of June 2013. dataACT is led and supported by the ACT GIO in collaboration with Shared Services ICT.

Approaching our second year, there is a renewed focus to released high-value datasets. We have also launched a [consultation](http://gio.act.gov.au/dataset-consultation/) to gather community requests for dataset releases. The suggestions will be used to help inform Directorates of the need for more open data releases.
