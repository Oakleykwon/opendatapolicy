<a name="purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose</h2>

<p>This policy concerns the proactive provision of data to the public, in support of an overall 'disclosure as default' philosophy. Specifically, this policy assists Directorates implement the Open Government principles of transparency, participation and collaboration.</p>

<p><strong>This is a draft policy, with application across ACT Government.</strong></p>

<h2>
<a name="background" class="anchor" href="#background"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h2>

<p>The ACT Government is committed to the principles of Open Government, which means:</p>

<ul>
<li>transparency in process and information</li>
<li>participation by citizens in the governing process</li>
<li>public collaboration in finding solutions to problems, and participation in the improved well-being of the community.</li>
</ul><p>In her statement to the Legislative Assembly on 23 June 2011, the Chief Minister indicated that the ACT Public Service would move to an information 'disclosure as default' position in all its operations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While there will always be some restrictions here the default position will be that Government information becomes available to the community. (<a href="http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/hansard/2011/week06/2425.htm">Hansard</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The policy supports procedural change and pragmatic thinking. It represents a move away from sole reliance on the 'pull' process in requests for specific information under Freedom of Information legislation towards a complementary 'push' strategies aligned with Open Government principles.</p>

<p>This policy mandates provision of as much high quality non-exempt data to the community as is practicable using current resources. In implementing this policy, there will be inherent resource limitations that require practical compromises and the exercise of judgement. Over time, we expect to build our capacity and capability, informed by community feedback about what data it values.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, it is reasonable to implement the strategy incrementally. The policy recognises that it is generally easier to build data extraction requirements into new systems rather than existing ones.</p>

<a name="scope" class="anchor" href="#scope"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scope</h2>

<p>This policy applies to all new information system development efforts as well as projects that update or redevelop existing information systems launched after xx/xx/xx.</p>

<h2>
<a name="policy" class="anchor" href="#policy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Policy</h2>

<h3>
<a name="principles" class="anchor" href="#principles"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Principles</h3>

<p>ACT Government data shall be considered open under this policy if it complies with the following principles:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Public.</strong> As per the <a href="http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/alt_a1989-46co/default.asp">Freedom of Information Act 1989</a>, the community has a right to access information in the possession of the ACT Government, subject to legislation including exemptions relating to the publication of FOI material such as privacy, security, confidentiality and Cabinet Data. See <a href="#Considerations">Considerations</a> for further discussion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Primary.</strong> Data should be published as collected, not in aggregate or modified forms, unless the provision of data at its most granular level would not be practicable or permitted by law or other requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accessible.</strong> Data should be made available to the widest practical range of users for the widest range of uses. Publication of data should be properly structured and encoded in machine-readable, non-proprietary formats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timely.</strong> Data should be made available in a timely fashion, taking into consideration the nature of the dataset in order to determine what is considered an acceptable timeframe for release. Time-sensitive data sets should be updated at the same frequency with which the data changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reusable.</strong> Data should be released under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence (CC BY 3.0 AU)</a>, allowing users the right to share and remix data.</p></li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h3>

<p>Where databases include data elements that are exempt from public disclosure or contain personally identifiable information, data extractions should be created for publication that excludes such data elements. </p>

<p>Metadata to enable interpretation of data elements by third party researchers and developers will be provided to standards as directed by Shared Services ICT.</p>

<p>During the implementation or upgrade of any information system, a review of data for publication must by conducted with a view to disclosing data wherever possible. Identified data eligible for Proactive Information Disclosure must first be published within a reasonable time frame, not exceeding three months after the installation or upgrade of the system.</p>

<p>Where it has been identified that no datasets can be published, an exemption declaration must be submitted to the Government Information Office (GIO).</p>

<a name="implementation" class="anchor" href="#implementation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implementation</h2>

<h3>
<a name="roles-and-responsibilities" class="anchor" href="#roles-and-responsibilities"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Roles and responsibilities</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Directorate Information Release Officer (DIRO).</strong> Authorises release of information to the community.</li>
<li>
<strong>Government Information Office (GIO).</strong> Communicate strategic value of open data to stakeholders, provides advice and guidelines to support policy implementation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data Custodian.</strong> Creates or manages government data in accordance with the policy requirements.</li>
<li>
<strong>Technical Support.</strong> Provides technical assurance and management for the publication of data.</li>
<li>
<strong>All staff.</strong> Actively supports and contributes to open data initiatives.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="open-data-plans" class="anchor" href="#open-data-plans"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open data plans</h3>

<p>In conjunction with the GIO and Shared Services ICT, each Directorate is required to prepare and implement a plan for the publication of open data on <a href="http://www.data.act.gov.au">dataACT</a>.</p>

<p>Open data plans should be considered as part of procurement processes. The costs of extraction to new systems should in future be included in the overall project costings. The cost of creating macros and the other software to automate extraction of data from existing computer systems is expected to be minimal for systems developed in recent years.</p>

<h3>
<a name="community-consultation" class="anchor" href="#community-consultation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Community consultation</h3>

<p>An ongoing process of online community consultation will be undertaken by the GIO seeking priorities for the release of datasets, and determining appropriate formats for release. These priorities will information the identification of high-value data or data that should be open, yet is only available in closed data formats. Identification of such data will assist in the formation of open data plans and ongoing open data efforts.</p>

<a name="considerations" class="anchor" href="#considerations"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Considerations</h2>

<h3>
<a name="exemptions-from-public-disclosure" class="anchor" href="#exemptions-from-public-disclosure"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exemptions from public disclosure</h3>

<p>As a general principle, exemptions to online public disclosure of Government data are the same as those in place for online publishing of FOI material. This includes exemptions through issues of privacy, commercial confidentiality, security and Cabinet Data.  </p>

<h3>
<a name="confidentiality" class="anchor" href="#confidentiality"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Confidentiality</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding requirements of this policy, staff should:</p>

<ul>
<li>be aware that unauthorised disclosure of classified or sensitive information is a breach of the provisions of the <a href="http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/1994-37/default.asp">Public Sector Management Act 1994</a>;</li>
<li>be aware that unauthorised disclosure may also constitute a breach of other legislation such as the Commonwealth <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712">Privacy Act 1988</a>, the Territory <a href="http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/1997-125/default.asp">Health Records (Privacy and Access) Act 1997</a> or the Territory <a href="http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2011-4/default.asp">Workplace Privacy Act 2011</a>; and</li>

<p>Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to determine an individual's identity, either standalone or when combined with other information that can be connected to a specific individual. All staff involved in the process of proactively releasing data should be aware of the risks posed with the release of potentially personally-identifiable or sensitive information.  Consideration should be given as to whether such data could be used in combination with other existing data to identify individuals.</p>
