{"name":"Open Data Policy","tagline":"Draft Proactive Information Disclosure (Open Data) Policy","body":"## Purpose\r\n\r\nThis policy concerns the proactive provision of data to the public, in support of an overall 'disclosure as default' philosophy. Specifically, this policy assists Directorates implement the Open Government principles of transparency, participation and collaboration.\r\n\r\n**This is a draft policy, with application across ACT Government.**\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThe ACT Government is committed to the principles of Open Government, which means:\r\n\r\n* transparency in process and information\r\n* participation by citizens in the governing process\r\n* public collaboration in finding solutions to problems, and participation in the improved well-being of the community.\r\n\r\nIn her statement to the Legislative Assembly on 23 June 2011, the Chief Minister indicated that the ACT Public Service would move to an information 'disclosure as default' position in all its operations.\r\n\r\n> While there will always be some restrictions here the default position will be that Government information becomes available to the community. ([Hansard](http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/hansard/2011/week06/2425.htm))\r\n\r\nThe policy supports procedural change and pragmatic thinking. It represents a move away from sole reliance on the 'pull' process in requests for specific information under Freedom of Information legislation towards a complementary 'push' strategies aligned with Open Government principles.\r\n\r\nThis policy mandates provision of as much high quality non-exempt data to the community as is practicable using current resources. In implementing this policy, there will be inherent resource limitations that require practical compromises and the exercise of judgement. Over time, we expect to build our capacity and capability, informed by community feedback about what data it values.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, it is reasonable to implement the strategy incrementally. The policy recognises that it is generally easier to build data extraction requirements into new systems rather than existing ones.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Glossary\r\n\r\n* *Data.* Structured information in a raw or pre-interpreted form. Data does not contain an explicit narrative.\r\n* *Dataset.* A collection of data in tabular or non-tabular form.\r\n* *Open data.* Publicly available data that can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone.\r\n* *Closed data.* Data that restricts access or reuse by way of aggregation, proprietary formats, time limits, passwords, license or copyright.\r\n* *High-quality data.* Data which is accurate, updated in an appropriately managed time-dram\r\n* *Real-time data.* Data subject to real-time constraints.\r\n* *Open government data.* Data produced or commissioned by government or government-controlled entities that can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone.\r\n* *GIO.* Government Information Office, Policy and Cabinet Division, Chief Minister and Treasury Directorate.\r\n* *Government information.* Production level data, final documents and reports (not drafts) which are created through the undertaking of Government business.\r\n* *Record.* Information created and kept, or received and kept, as evidence and information by a person in accordance with a legal obligation or in the course of conducting business; and includes information in written, electronic or any other form.\r\n* *dataACT.* The designated portal for ACT Government non-exempt data release.\r\n* *Personally identifiable information.* Information that can be used to determine an individual's identity, either standalone or combined with other information that can be connected to a specific individual.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Scope\r\n\r\nThis policy applies to all new information system development efforts as well as projects that update or redevelop existing information systems launched after xx/xx/xx.\r\n\r\n## Policy\r\n\r\n### Principles\r\n\r\nACT Government data shall be considered open under this policy if it complies with the following principles:\r\n\r\n* **Public.** As per the [Freedom of Information Act 1989](http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/alt_a1989-46co/default.asp), the community has a right to access information in the possession of the ACT Government, subject to legislation including exemptions relating to the publication of FOI material such as privacy, security, confidentiality and Cabinet Data. See [Considerations](#Considerations) for further discussion.\r\n\r\n* **Primary.** Data should be published as collected, not in aggregate or modified forms, unless the provision of data at its most granular level would not be practicable or permitted by law or other requirements.\r\n\r\n* **Accessible.** Data should be made available to the widest practical range of users for the widest range of uses. Publication of data should be properly structured and encoded in machine-readable, non-proprietary formats.\r\n\r\n* **Timely.** Data should be made available in a timely fashion, taking into consideration the nature of the dataset in order to determine what is considered an acceptable timeframe for release. Time-sensitive data sets should be updated at the same frequency with which the data changes.\r\n\r\n* **Reusable.** Data should be released under [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence (CC BY 3.0 AU)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/), allowing users the right to share and remix data.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nWhere databases include data elements that are exempt from public disclosure or contain personally identifiable information, data extractions should be created for publication that excludes such data elements. \r\n\r\nMetadata to enable interpretation of data elements by third party researchers and developers will be provided to standards as directed by Shared Services ICT.\r\n\r\nDuring the implementation or upgrade of any information system, a review of data for publication must by conducted with a view to disclosing data wherever possible. Identified data eligible for Proactive Information Disclosure must first be published within a reasonable time frame, not exceeding three months after the installation or upgrade of the system.\r\n\r\nWhere it has been identified that no datasets can be published, an exemption declaration must be submitted to the Government Information Office (GIO).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n### Roles and responsibilities\r\n\r\n* **Directorate Information Release Officer (DIRO).** Authorises release of information to the community.\r\n* **Government Information Office (GIO).** Communicate strategic value of open data to stakeholders, provides advice and guidelines to support policy implementation.\r\n* **Data Custodian.** Creates or manages government data in accordance with the policy requirements.\r\n* **Technical Support.** Provides technical assurance and management for the publication of data.\r\n* **All staff.** Actively supports and contributes to open data initiatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Open data plans\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the GIO and Shared Services ICT, each Directorate is required to prepare and implement a plan for the publication of open data on [dataACT](http://www.data.act.gov.au).\r\n\r\nOpen data plans should be considered as part of procurement processes. The costs of extraction to new systems should in future be included in the overall project costings. The cost of creating macros and the other software to automate extraction of data from existing computer systems is expected to be minimal for systems developed in recent years.\r\n\r\n### Community consultation\r\n\r\nAn ongoing process of online community consultation will be undertaken by the GIO seeking priorities for the release of datasets, and determining appropriate formats for release. These priorities will information the identification of high-value data or data that should be open, yet is only available in closed data formats. Identification of such data will assist in the formation of open data plans and ongoing open data efforts.\r\n\r\n## Considerations\r\n\r\n### Exemptions from public disclosure\r\n\r\nAs a general principle, exemptions to online public disclosure of Government data are the same as those in place for online publishing of FOI material. This includes exemptions through issues of privacy, commercial confidentiality, security and Cabinet Data.  \r\n\r\n### Confidentiality\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding requirements of this policy, staff should:\r\n\r\n* be aware that unauthorised disclosure of classified or sensitive information is a breach of the provisions of the [Public Sector Management Act 1994](http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/1994-37/default.asp);\r\n* be aware that unauthorised disclosure may also constitute a breach of other legislation such as the Commonwealth [Privacy Act 1988](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712), the Territory [Health Records (Privacy and Access) Act 1997](http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/1997-125/default.asp) or the Territory [Workplace Privacy Act 2011](http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2011-4/default.asp); and\r\n* apply confidentiality, privacy and classification standards (*ACT Government Protective Security Policy and Guidelines*), practices and requirements to the storage retrieval, access and dissemination of information.\r\n\r\n### Personally identifiable information\r\n\r\nPersonally identifiable information is information that can be used to determine an individual's identity, either standalone or when combined with other information that can be connected to a specific individual. All staff involved in the process of proactively releasing data should be aware of the risks posed with the release of potentially personally-identifiable or sensitive information.  Consideration should be given as to whether such data could be used in combination with other existing data to identify individuals.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
